# MicrobitArduino
*This project is a work in progress.*

## Purpose
Creation of a robot using an arduino nano which can communicate with one microbit via its serial port and allow for that microbit to communicate with another microbit which the user controls in order to remotely control a robot.

## Diagram
The robot used in this project is a redesign of the robot used in this project: https://github.com/sabrinabutton/arduino-line-movement
